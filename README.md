# Latte_Compiler
A Haskell written Complier for Latte language, done for compiler construction course. It will most likely compile to x86.
## Running the compiler

You can run the compile and run the compiler using following commands:
```
make
./latc file_name.lat
```
More information can be found by typing
```
make
./latc -h
```

## Frontend structure & description
***
There are three main folders inside the frontend part of the compiler:
- **Lang** \
    Lang folder stores the Latte.cf file which describes the syntax of a latte program.
    The grammar is written using BNFC and the file is later used to generate parser files.
- **Parser** \
    Parser stores all autogenerated (by BNFC, alex and happy) files, which are used to parse the
    program, check for syntax errors and return a program tree.
- **Synthesis** \
    Synthesis consists of three stages, each represented by one of the main file, Ast, Typecheck
    and Optimizer. Ast stores and converts the bnfc program tree into my own structure which optimizes
    some syntax constructors (swapping a for loop to a while, changing increment and decrement to regular
    operations etc.) Typecheck is mainly responsible for checking program correctness as well as doing some
    minor changes in ast. Lastly there is an optimizer, which removes dead code and folds the constants.

## (Planned) Extensions
***
I'm planning on doing the following extensions:
- **Removing dead code and folding constants** 
- **Arrays**
- **Structs**
- **Classes with inheritance**
- **Virtual methods**
    
## Used tools and libraries
***
Compiler uses BNFC as a grammar tool and alex + happy for parser generations.
There aren't any unusual libraries in the code. Most of them are related to data structures 
(Map, Set, List) or Monads (ExceptT, ReaderT, StateT, IO).

## Pre-defined functions and classes
***    
Compiler has five pre-defined functions:
- error(), which throws a runtime exception, effectively stopping the program from further execution,
- printInt(i), which prints a given integer to stdout,
- printString(i), which prints a given string to stdout,
- readInt(), which reads an int from stdin,
- readString(), which reads a string (line) from stdin.

There are also three pre-defined classes:
- Object, which is a parent of all classes and has an 'equals' method,
- Array, which is a class used for representing arrays - This class elements are immutable,
- String, which is a class equivalent of string primitive type and has a 'concat' method.
